## Image Processing Assignment


This code loads an image using OpenCV, converts it to grayscale, and applies various image processing operations on the grayscale image using OpenCV functions. The resulting images are then displayed using Matplotlib.

The image processing operations applied are:

-- Addition of a constant value (90) to each pixel value of the grayscale image.
-- Subtraction of a constant value (90) from each pixel value of the grayscale image.
-- Multiplication of each pixel value of the grayscale image by a constant value (1.5).
-- Inverting the grayscale image by taking the bitwise complement of each pixel value.

The resulting images are displayed in a 3x3 grid using Matplotlib. The first column of the grid shows the original color image, the second column shows the grayscale image, and the remaining columns show the result of each image processing operation. Each image is displayed with a title indicating the name of the processing operation.

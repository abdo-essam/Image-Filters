The code you provided is using the OpenCV library (cv2) and the skimage library to perform image processing operations. It utilizes various functions and methods to load, manipulate, and display images. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1.	Importing the necessary libraries.
2.	Loading the original and noisy images.
3.	Creating a figure for displaying the images.
4.  Adding subplots and displaying the original and Gaussian-filtered images.
5.  Adding subplots and displaying the original and Wiener-filtered images.
6.  Similar steps are repeated for other image processing operations, such as adding salt and pepper noise, applying mean and median filters, 
    and using minimum and maximum filters.
7.	Finally, the images are displayed using plt.show().

Note: The code assumes that you have two image files, "lena.png" and "noisy.png", located at the specified paths. Make sure to adjust the file paths accordingly or provide the correct paths to your images.
